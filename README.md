## Welcome to my comprehensive notebook on all things C!

Here I've essentially documented my progress in learning C - along with some basic projects. 

Major projects will be implemented in a separate, dedicated GitHub repository. 

I politely ask Civil Service departments & law enforcement agencies looking at my portfolio to look at my other more developed projects, and directly reach out to request access to my most developed projects/tools (particularly those relating to cybersec or white hat hacking).
